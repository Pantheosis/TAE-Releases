# Before running: pip install pyinstaller pyinstaller-hooks-contrib

# several of its dependencies; without it you will likely need to add more

# These packages ship data files, C extensions, or dynamic imports that
# static analysis alone won't find -- pull in everything for each.
# NOTE: "webview" (pywebview's actual import name -- not the "pywebview"
# distribution name) was MISSING from this list entirely in earlier
# versions of this spec. pywebview's platform backends (edgechromium.py,
# winforms.py, mshtml.py, cocoa.py, etc.) are imported dynamically inside
# functions in guilib.py, which PyInstaller's static analysis can't see --
# so without explicitly collecting them, some backends silently never
# make it into the bundle at all. That's what caused pywebview to keep
# falling through to the broken legacy WinForms/IE renderer even after
# explicitly forcing gui="edgechromium" in desktop_launcher.py: the
# edgechromium backend module itself wasn't present to import.
# NOTE: pyswisseph's PyPI distribution name and its actual import name
# ("swisseph") differ -- listing "pyswisseph" here silently collects
# nothing, since collect_all() operates on the importable module name, not
# the PyPI package name. This went unnoticed for a while because every
# earlier build crashed (on pywebview issues) before app.py ever got far
# enough to actually execute `import swisseph`.
